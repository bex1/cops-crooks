    <string name="instructions"><b>Intro</b>\n
		Cops and Crooks is about getting the most money.
		One of the players controls the law enforcement (Cops) and the rest of the players are thieves (Crooks).
		The Crooks get money by robbing banks, post offices etc., while the Cops get money by catching and arresting Crooks. 
		When a Cop arrests a Crook, he receives a share of the Crooks cash.
		The winner is the player with the most money when the game ends.\n
		
		\n<b>How the Cops move</b>\n
		The player playing as the Cops get to move only  one of his or hers pawns each turn, either a policeman or the paddy wagon (which is two tiles big). 
		The pawn can move either vertically or horizontally.
		The paddy wagons move two steps for every dot on the die, however, it can only move forward. 
		A policeman can go through a building that is open to two direction. 
		The paddy wagon cannot do this, it is limited to driving on the road. 
		The policemen and paddy wagon can pass by each other but not stop on the same tile.\n
		
		\n<b>How the Crooks move</b>\n
		The player playing as a Crook move his or her pawn the same as the policeman, either vertically or horizontally.
		A Crook must always move on his or her turn, they cannot skip it. 
		There can’t more than one Crook on a tile at any given moment. 
		Crooks can always pass by each other on the board. 
		A Crook can only pass by a policeman or the paddy wagon if the Crook is not Wanted.\n

		A Crook becomes Wanted if he or she:\n
			•	robs a Bank, Post office or the Travel agency\n
			•	escapes the jail\n
			•	collects stolen cash from the hideout\n
